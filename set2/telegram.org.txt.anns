in O
Secret O
Chats O

When O
you O
send O

via O
secret O

before O
being O
uploaded, O
each O
item O
is O

— O
and O
sent O
to O
your O
recipient. O
They O
can O
then O
download O
and O

the O

This O
means O
that O
the O
file O
is O
technically O
on O
one O
of O
Telegram’s O
servers, O
but O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
piece O
of O

to O
everyone O
except O
for O
you O
and O
the O

We O
don’t O

what O
this O

stands O
for O
and O
we O
have O
no O

which O

it O
belongs O
to. O
We O
periodically O

this O

Receive E-First Party Collection and Use

In B-First Party Collection and Use

Bots O
can O
also O
receive O
the O
following O
data O
when O
you O
interact O
with O
them. O

Bots O
will O
obviously O
get O
your O
messages O
when O
you O
send O
them O
something. O

If O
you O
click O
on O
links O
or O
buttons O
provided O
by O
the O
bot, O
the O
bot O
can O
potentially O
get O
your O
IP O
address O
(provided O
that O
it O
controls O
the O
website O
to O
which O
the O
link O
leads). O

If O
the O
bot O
is O
a O
member O
of O
the O
same O
group O
with O
you, O
it O
may O
know O
you O
are O
a O
member. O

When O
you O
start O
your O
message O
with O
the O
username O
of O
an O
inline O
bot O
(e.g. O
@gif) O
the O
interface O
transforms O
so O
that O
everything O
you O
type O
becomes O
a O
query O
to O
that O
bot. O
This O
query O
is O
sent O
to O
the O
bot O
so O
that O
it O
can O
provide O
its O
service. O
We O
will O
warn O
you O
about O
this O
the O
first O
time O
you O
use O
an O
inline O
bot. O

Bots O
added O
to O
groups O
can O
operate O
in O
two O
modes: O
with O
access O
to O
messages O
in O
the O
group O
or O
without O
access. O
If O
the O
bot O
has O
access O
to O
messages, O
it O
can O
see O
everything O
that O
happens O
in O
the O
group. O
The O
interface O
clearly O
shows O
whether O
or O
not O
a O
bot O
has O
access O
to O
messages O
in O
groups. O
