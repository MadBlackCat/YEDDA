For O

We O
therefore O
recommend O

restrictions O
and O
limitations O
imposed O
by O
the O
official O
operating O

It O
could O
make O
your O

vulnerable O
to O
malware/viruses/malicious O
programs, O
compromise O
your O

security O
features O
and O
it O
could O
mean O
that O
the O
Tunnel O
Light O

app O
won’t O
work O

at O
all. O

You O
